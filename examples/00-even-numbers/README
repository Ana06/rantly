HOW TO RUN

  $ cd examples/00-even-numbers
  $ rspec spec/tests.rb


WHAT IT DOES

  It creates an array of random small numbers.
  It then verifies they are all even (which they are not, of course).
  Rantly then shrinks that sample of data to a smaller failing set.


EXTERNAL TESTED PROGRAM

  None, everything is in the test.


INTERNAL MODEL

  None, the random data are tested directly.


USED CLASSES

  Integer:   standard Ruby integer
  Deflating: deflating array (here: of integers)
