  $ gcc -o circular_buffer circular_buffer_bugged.c
  $ rspec tests/tests.rb

WHAT IT DOES

  This example takes its inspiration from the must-see video

EXTERNAL TESTED PROGRAM

   circular_buffer_bugged.c tries to implement a queue of integers
   with a circular buffer that is stored into a text file.
   This is an intentionally bugged version.

   circular_buffer.c is the fixed version that applies the old trick
   of allocating one more element in the buffer than we want to use.

USED CLASSES:

  Integer:   standard Ruby integer
  Operation: modelize one of three operations put(value), get() or size();
             we could simply have used a symbol, but this convenience class
             enables to pretty-print
  Deflating: deflating array (here: of operations)
  Tuple:     array of shrinking values values
             (here: two elements, the operations and the size of the queue)
